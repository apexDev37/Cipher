> Attempt to pair with an LLM to supercharge user account recovery protocols.

## Introduction

Cipher is a small, LLM-powered, application that aims to enhance user account recovery. This goal is accomplished by integrating an LLM into the account recovery protocol and process. Cipher demonstrates a real-life scenario of abstracting/hiding sensitive and confidential data in a process dependent and tightly coupled to a Large Language Model. This comes about by distributing business logic concerns to the application and delegating generative-dependent responsibilities to the LLM.

### Motivation

This repo is primarily for learning and experimental purposes to leverage in future production AI-powered applications. I've recently been delving into and learning about web security due to a critical system I'm working on. Hence the theme and name for this repo which allows me to wear and test my "security hat"ðŸ¤ ðŸ’¥
