## Introduction

Cipher is a small, LLM-powered, application that aims to enhance user account recovery. This is achieved by integrating an LLM into the account recovery protocol and process. Cipher showcases a real-life scenario of abstracting/hiding sensitive data in a process closely coupled to a Large Language Model. This is achieved by delegating business logic concerns to the application and assigning generative-dependent responsibilities to the LLM.

### Motivation

This repository is primarily for learning and experimentation, with the aim of leveraging it in future AI-powered, production-grade applications. I've recently been delving into and learning web security, prompted by a critical system I'm working on. Hence the theme and name for this repo which allows me to wear and test my "security hat"ðŸ¤ ðŸ’¥

## Installing / Getting Started

This is an overview of the minimal setup needed to get started.

### Prerequisites

- [Git]
- [Python]
- IDE, Code/Text editor ([PyCharm], [VScode], [Vim], etc)

### Local Setup

> The following commands were run on Ubuntu focal (20.04.6 LTS)

- **Clone repository**

```bash
    # cd your/desired/target/dir
    $ git clone git@github.com:apexDev37/Cipher.git cipher
    $ cd cipher
```

> This command clones the repository into a target directory on your local machine with the name `cipher/` and navigates into the repository's root directory.

Create a virtual environment with your preferred package manager to isolate Cipher's required dependencies. I'm using `virtualenvwrapper`. See more details on [virtual environments] and [virtualenv].

- **Create virtual environment**

```bash
    $ mkvirtualenv -p python3.12 cipher
```

> This will create and activate a managed virtual env called `cipher` using a Python `3.12.x` interpreter on your local machine. Note: If you are not using `virtualenvwrapper`, run the command to create your virtual environment from the project's root directory.

- **Install required packages**

```bash
    # We need `pip-sync` for the next command
    $ pip install -r <(cat requirements/pip.txt requirements/pip-tools.txt)
    # Install packages and sync your venv
    $ pip-sync requirements/*.txt
```

> First, install `pip` and `pip-tools` requirements to access additional package management utilities. Next, use `pip-sync` to install all project requirements and _synchronize_ our active virtual environment with pinned package versions.

> âš  Note, if you face an issue while installing requirements, particularly with `langflow`, run the following setup commands and rerun `pip-sync ...`.

```bash
    # Ensure you have Python dev headers
    $ sudo apt install python3.x-dev    # Replace with your py version
    # Install other required dependencies
    $ sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev

```

> This first installs Python development headers on your local machine. Next, other dependencies essential for compiling and building Python packages, especially those with C extensions are installed.
